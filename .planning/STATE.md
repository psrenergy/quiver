# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-24)

**Core value:** A single, clean C++ API that exposes full SQLite schema capabilities through uniform, mechanically-derived bindings.
**Current focus:** Phase 5 - C API FK Tests

## Current Position

Phase: 5 of 8 (C API FK Tests)
Plan: 0 of ? in current phase
Status: Ready to plan
Last activity: 2026-02-24 -- Roadmap created for v1.1 FK Test Coverage

Progress: [####------] 40% (4/8 phases, v1.0 complete)

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 6 (v1.0)
- Average duration: --

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
All v1.0 decisions resolved -- see .planning/milestones/v1.0-ROADMAP.md for full history.

v1.1 context: Each binding layer mirrors the same 16 C++ FK tests (9 create + 7 update). C++ tests are the reference; bindings adapt to their API conventions.
