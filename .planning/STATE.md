## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Roadmap: Interleaved approach -- fix one layer at a time (C++ -> C -> Julia -> Dart), making it consistent AND complete per layer
- Roadmap: Extract Impl header as separate phase before decomposition (research recommendation)
- Roadmap: TEST requirements assigned to Phase 10 as final gate; each phase still verifies tests as success criteria
