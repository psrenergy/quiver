## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: CFFI ABI mode chosen for Python FFI (no compiler at install time)
- [Roadmap]: Package name changes from "margaux" to "quiver" — first action in Phase 1 (INFRA-01)
- [Roadmap]: CSV-02 (import_csv) flagged as likely unimplemented in C++ — verify at Phase 6 planning
- [Roadmap]: CONV-04 (DateTime helpers) included in scope; research recommends returning raw ISO strings — confirm at Phase 6

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Phase 6]: CSV-02 (import_csv) may not exist in C++ layer. Verify `quiver_database_import_csv` in C API headers before binding. Drop from scope if absent.
- [Phase 6]: CONV-04 (DateTime helpers) — research recommends deferring. Confirm scope decision at Phase 6 planning.
